Rate My Photos!

This app is made for Photographers!

  I created this app so that Photographers could post and rate photos using a rating system.
I started on this by thinking of a way to help photographers get better. After learning ember I decided it would be
great if Photographers could use an app to get better.

  First I used the ember auth template to get that up and running. I made sure there were no bugs within
any auth services. Then I worked my way into doing one function at a time (CRUD Functions). I then did a little bit
of styling before downloading an ember package for my star-rating.

 Star-rating was easy to install. I went over to https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-cli-star-rating
and then followed the instructions. Before doing that though, you have to install dependencies by doing "npm install" and then "bower install" for Ember. After inputing "ember install ember-cli-star-rating" into my terminal,
I was ready to go.
